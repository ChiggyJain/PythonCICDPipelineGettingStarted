# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  # first job as CI to build and test the code
  build:

    # run on the latest version of ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # all steps will run in a single runner, allowing you to share data between steps
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip

  # second job as CD to deploy the code, only if the build job is successful and on main branch
